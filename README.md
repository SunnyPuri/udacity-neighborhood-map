## Feature

A neighborhood map is a single page application where you can feature a map of your neighborhood. It is using FoureSquare API's to highlight the nearby shops in the map.

## APIs
Google Maps API is used here to show the map and generate the markers etc.
Foursquare API is used to pull more information on my favorite locations and provide a more complete listing when you click on the marker and the infoWindow shows up.

## Offline Use (Service Worker)
When available in the browser, the site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets. Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.
